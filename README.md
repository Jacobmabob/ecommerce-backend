  ## Description

  This project is a simple implementation of an E-commerce Backend using Express.js, MySql and Sequelize. My objective was to fix the api routes test them with Insomnia, an API design platform.

  ## Usage
  The data is organized into three major components: Products, Tags and Categories, each with their own corresponding API routes.
